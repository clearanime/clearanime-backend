Their lives are filled with giant robots, true love, and intense drama... in their colorful imaginations, at least. In reality, they are just an everyday trio of ordinary guys trying to pass the time, but who said everyday life couldn't be interesting? Whether it's an intricate RPG reenactment or an unexpected romantic encounter on the riverbank at sunset, Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is rife with bizarre yet hilariously relatable situations that are anything but mundane.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","title":"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou","updated_at":"2022-01-22T17:30:43+00:00"},"last_updated":0,"variants":[{"id":"danshi-koukousei-no-nichijou-dub","label":"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou (Dub)","episodes":[{"label":"0","link":"https://www30.gogoplay.in/www02/U1rBHrAaFWfJ8HiX-Wrq_Q/1642964468/18e9a68744937956f94629ad909b1cc1/ep.1.1638614886.m3u8","added_in":1642916652}],"last_updated":1642916652}]}
