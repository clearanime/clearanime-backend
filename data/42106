Before he can ascend to his new position among the Gods, he is ordered to execute the Nine-Tailed Fox Demon who threatens the mortals' very existence. But when the Fox Demon shows him the secret to her power, an innocent human girl, he is unable to complete his task resulting in his banishment to the mortal realm forever. Ten years later, atop the ruins of war, Jiang Ziya is once again given a task that will bring him back to the Heavenly realm – execute the Nine Tail Fox Demon regardless if the innocent life is lost.
