It's not intended to be scary in the slightest, but rather, it focuses on the comical and bizarre things Zombie-kun's body can do, and the common-sense-defying way Zombie-kun behaves. For example, he'll take out his stomach and inflate it with air to use as a pillow, or if he gets wet, he'll detach parts of his body and wring them out like towels, then reattach them with a glue stick. Everything is depicted in a cute, cartoony fashion so as not to be too graphic for kids.\n\n(Source: Baka-Updates)","title":"Zo Zo Zo Zombie-kun (TV)","updated_at":"2021-10-31T16:47:14+00:00"},"last_updated":0,"variants":[{"id":"zo-zo-zo-zombie-kun-tv-dub","label":"Zo Zo Zo Zombie-kun (TV) (Dub)","episodes":[{"label":"1","link":"https://www13.gogoplay.in/www02/T9EdaywJwTLmu0qoP2Ruzw/1642997718/4cb17aff5d83473b97f3ee43f5fc2f97/ep.2.v0.1641381602.m3u8","added_in":1642911318},{"label":"0","link":"https://www16.gogoplay.in/www03/T9EdaywJwTLmu0qoP2Ruzw/1642997718/4aa932fd2bc0159edbbe3492b809d897/ep.1.v0.1641382622.m3u8","added_in":1642911318},{"label":"2","link":"https://www16.anicdn.stream/astream/563dc80002dedfa4b993b5084dca3bcd/zo-zo-zo-zombie-kun-tv-dub-episode-3.1641381132.m3u8","added_in":1642911319},{"label":"4","link":"https://www16.anicdn.stream/astream/563dc80002dedfa4b993b5084dca3bcd/zo-zo-zo-zombie-kun-tv-dub-episode-5.1641381072.m3u8","added_in":1642911320},{"label":"3","link":"https://www16.anicdn.stream/astream/563dc80002dedfa4b993b5084dca3bcd/zo-zo-zo-zombie-kun-tv-dub-episode-4.1641380771.m3u8","added_in":1642911320},{"label":"6","link":"https://www16.anicdn.stream/astream/563dc80002dedfa4b993b5084dca3bcd/zo-zo-zo-zombie-kun-tv-dub-episode-7.1641380952.m3u8","added_in":1642911320},{"label":"8","link":"https://www17.gogoplay.in/www01/YKQlCUfQRYRUim9JTfe0DA/1642997720/90a8fce67d3f7bee7a1cd53eabf210d5/ep.9.v0.1641381122.m3u8","added_in":1642911320},{"label":"5","link":"https://www16.anicdn.stream/astream/563dc80002dedfa4b993b5084dca3bcd/zo-zo-zo-zombie-kun-tv-dub-episode-6.1641381013.m3u8","added_in":1642911320},{"label":"7","link":"https://www16.anicdn.stream/astream/563dc80002dedfa4b993b5084dca3bcd/zo-zo-zo-zombie-kun-tv-dub-episode-8.1641380893.m3u8","added_in":1642911321}],"last_updated":1642911321}]}
