Wary of the future, she seeks advice from her mentor Alicia Florence—one of the three great \"Water Fairies\" of Neo-Venezia.\n\nMuch to Akari's surprise, Alicia reveals her own struggles of the past, but also shares the steps she took in overcoming her self-doubt of running the company and taking on an apprentice. Finding solace in her teacher's words, Akari prepares to embrace whatever trials she must overcome on her path toward achieving her dreams.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n","title":"Aria the OVA: Arietta","updated_at":"2022-01-20T22:38:35+00:00"},"last_updated":0,"variants":[{"id":"aria-the-ova-arietta-dub","label":"Aria the OVA: Arietta (Dub)","episodes":[{"label":"0","link":"https://www09.gogoplay.in/www02/tDjPdFK0Ht5x8EqsmzRbTg/1642997685/5c6ba1643c2123d2abe2b755425d5158/ep.1.1640108687.m3u8","added_in":1642915057}],"last_updated":1642915057}]}
