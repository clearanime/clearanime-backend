One day, the Nohara family was looking forward to having an ultra-rich yakiniku dinner, but they were put on the Wanted List on suspicion of heinous crimes because of a scheme of a mysterious organization named Sweet Boys. The Nohara family must run from Sweet Boys' pursuit but to eat yakiniku for dinner they need to stop escaping and decide to meet the boss of Sweet Boys, who is based in Atami (a hot spring/resort city in Shizuoka Prefecture).\n\n(Source: Manabu Tsuribe)","title":"Crayon Shin-chan Movie 11: Arashi wo Yobu Eikou no Yakiniku Road","updated_at":"2022-01-05T02:05:45+00:00"},"last_updated":0,"variants":[{"id":"crayon-shin-chan-movie-11-arashi-wo-yobu-eikou-no-yakiniku-road","label":"Crayon Shin-chan Movie 11: Arashi wo Yobu Eikou no Yakiniku Road","episodes":[{"label":"0","link":"https://www11.gogoplay.in/www01/N473qiQgGvAAmG8Zl9XPJA/1642962267/fbf4c9b6b5bc199b86e4dff5ed8df9ab/ep.1.1640902325.m3u8","added_in":1642914219}],"last_updated":1642914219}]}
